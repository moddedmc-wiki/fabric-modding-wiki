# Contributing

If you wish to contribute to the wiki, you are more than welcome!

## Content Guidelines

1. **Future-proof Content**: All contributed content should be easily updatable to accommodate future versions of Minecraft. Avoid using version-specific features or APIs that might become outdated quickly.

2. **Clear and Cohesive Writing**: Ensure that the content is easy to understand and follows a logical flow. While it doesn't have to be strictly step-by-step, it should present information in a coherent manner, allowing readers to follow along smoothly.

3. **Latest Minecraft Version**: All content should be based on the latest version of Minecraft. This helps maintain relevance and provides accurate information to users.

4. **Fabric API Usage**: If your contribution relies on the Fabric API, explicitly mention it in your content. You can do this either briefly, like "This page utilizes Fabric API's Y module," or directly state, "This page uses Fabric API."

## Contributing Process

1. **Fork the Repository**: To contribute, start by forking the official Fabric Community Wiki repository on GitHub. This will create a copy of the project in your GitHub account.

2. **Make Changes**: Create a new branch in your forked repository and make the necessary changes to the content. Ensure that your changes adhere to the contribution guidelines mentioned above.

3. **Test Your Changes**: If your contribution involves code snippets, test it thoroughly to confirm that it works as intended in the latest version of Minecraft. **All code must be present in the reference mod, found in the `reference-mod` folder.**

4. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Once you are satisfied with your changes, open a Pull Request from your branch to the main repository's `master` branch. Provide a clear and concise description of your changes in the PR to help reviewers understand your contribution better.

5. **Review Process**: Your PR will be reviewed by the community members or the maintainers of the Fabric Community Wiki. Be prepared to make further changes based on their feedback or suggestions.

6. **Merge and Publication**: If your PR meets the contribution guidelines and aligns with the objectives of the Fabric Community Wiki, it will be approved and merged into the main repository.
