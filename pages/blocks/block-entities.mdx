# Block Entities

With [Block States](/blocks/blockstates) you have already created pre-defined and finite data for your blocks.

For example, a redstone torch can be lit or unlit, an oak log can face six different directions and slabs can be waterlogged.

But how can you add data which may have near-endless possibilities, like the text on a sign block or the inventory which is implemented in a chest?

This is where block entities come in.

A `BlockEntity` is used to store custom data for blocks. Unlike normal blocks, they are bound to a world and have their own instantiated entity for each of their block positions. Data about the block entity is stored as NBT, using `readNbt` and `writeNbt` to ensure persistence when the world saves.

Block entities are also used for custom block rendering and can [handle ticks on the server side](/blocks/block-entities#implementing-blockentity-ticking) instead of the `Block`'s client-sided random ticks.

## Custom BlockEntity class

Create a new `TestBlockEntity` class which extends from `BlockEntity`, and implement the constructor.

The constructor of the `BlockEntity` class comes with three parameters by default: `type`, `pos` and `state`. Make sure to remove the type parameter otherwise the registration of the [BlockEntityType](/blocks/block-entities#registering-the-blockentity-with-a-blockentitytype) later on (with the class constructor reference `TestBlockEntity::new`) won't work.

```java
public class TestBlockEntity extends BlockEntity {
    // make sure the constructor's parameters are correct!
    public TestBlockEntity(BlockPos pos, BlockState state) {
        // We will create this BlockEntityType later on
        super(MyMod.TEST_BLOCK_ENTITY_TYPE, pos, state);
    }
}
```

## Preparing the custom Block class

There are two ways of adding a `BlockEntity` to a custom `Block`.

1. The custom Block class needs to implement the `BlockEntityProvider` interface.
2. The custom Block class needs to extend from `BlockWithEntity`.

Both ways require to `@Override` the `createBlockEntity` method. This is the only place where the custom `BlockEntity` class is instantiated.

```java
public class TestBlock extends BlockWithEntity {    
    // Instantiate your custom BlockEntity class
    @Nullable
    @Override
    public BlockEntity createBlockEntity(BlockPos pos, BlockState state) {
        return new TestBlockEntity(pos, state);
    }

    // When extending from BlockWithEntity, it would be invisible by default.
    // Make sure to pass in the correct BlockRenderType.
    @Override
    public BlockRenderType getRenderType(BlockState state) {
        return BlockRenderType.MODEL;
    }

    // ...
}
```

Remember to register your block.

## Registering the BlockEntity with a BlockEntityType

Several Blocks can share the same functionality. For example all versions of the bed block behave in the same way. It is possible to register multiple Blocks for a `BlockEntity` using a single `BlockEntityType`. Examples of this can be seen in the `BlockEntityType` class but the Fabric API registers them slightly differently.

Create the registry entry for the `BlockEntityType` in the `MyMod` and make a static reference for the `BlockEntityType` which has the custom `TestBlockEntity` class as a type parameter. This is used in the `TestBlockEntity`'s constructor.

```java
public class MyMod implements ModInitializer {
    // This BlockEntityType is referenced in the TestBlockEntity's constructor
    public static BlockEntityType<TestBlockEntity> TEST_BLOCK_ENTITY_TYPE;

    @Override
    public void onInitialize() {
    // ...
    TEST_BLOCK_ENTITY_TYPE = Registry.register(
                Registries.BLOCK_ENTITY_TYPE, new Identifier("mod_id", "test_block_entity"),
                FabricBlockEntityTypeBuilder.create(TestBlockEntity::new, ModBlocks.TEST_BLOCK)
                        // add as many .addBlock(...) here, as needed to support
                        // additional blocks for the same custom BlockEntity
                        .build()
        );
    }
}
```

This is considered quite messy, and can get really large when creating multiple block entity types.

## Cleaning up the mess

To avoid making the initialize method messy, create a new `ModBlockEntities` class and add a new method that will register all custom BlockEntityTypes.

```java
public class ModBlockEntities {
    public static BlockEntityType<TestBlockEntity> TEST_BLOCK_ENTITY_TYPE;

    public static void registerBlockEntityTypes() {        
        TEST_BLOCK_ENTITY_TYPE = Registry.register(
                Registries.BLOCK_ENTITY_TYPE, new Identifier(MyMod.MOD_ID, "test_block_entity"),
                FabricBlockEntityTypeBuilder.create(TestBlockEntity::new, ModBlocks.TEST_BLOCK).build()
        );        
        // add more BlockEntityTypes here, if needed
    }
}
```

This way, the `ModInitializer` implementing entry-point class needs to only have one line to register all custom BlockEntities.

```java
public class MyMod implements ModInitializer {
    
    @Override
    public void onInitialize() {
        ModBlockEntities.registerBlockEntityTypes();
        // ...
    }
}
    
```

The reference in the `TestBlockEntity` class' constructor needs to be changed as well.

```java
public class TestBlockEntity extends BlockEntity {
    public TestBlockEntity(BlockPos pos, BlockState state) {
        super(ModBlockEntities.TEST_BLOCK_ENTITY_TYPE, pos, state);
    }
    // ...
}
```

## How to use the custom BlockEntity

In this example, the custom `Block` class will be used to implement the functionality of the `Block` and it's `BlockEntity` will be used to keep track of how many times it is landed upon.

You can access the `BlockEntity`'s object with `world.getBlockEntity()` in your custom `Block` class.

```java
public class TestBlock extends BlockWithEntity {
    // ...
    
    // Executed when entities fall on the custom Block
    @Override
    public void onLandedUpon(World world, BlockState state, BlockPos pos, Entity entity, float fallDistance) {
        // Check for the custom BlockEntity
        if (world.getBlockEntity(pos) instanceof TestBlockEntity testBlockEntity && !world.isClient()) {
            // Using the Accessor of the custom BlockEntity
            int count = testBlockEntity.getInteractionCount();
            // Using the Mutator of the custom BlockEntity
            testBlockEntity.setInteractionCount(count + 1);            
            
            // Value output for the player in the chat
            if (entity instanceof PlayerEntity) {
                entity.sendMessage(Text.literal("You've stepped on this block " + testBlockEntity.getInteractionCount() + " times!"));
            }
        }

        // ...

        super.onLandedUpon(world, state, pos, entity, fallDistance);
    }    
}
```

The custom `BlockEntity` will get additional methods and variables to interact with, and save the incoming data from the custom `Block` class.

```java
public class TestBlockEntity extends BlockEntity {
    // Creating a field for the object's custom data
    private int interactionCount = 0;

    // A static String variable to avoid typos when refering to the NBT data
    private static final String INTERACT_NBT_KEY = "test_block.interaction";

    public TestBlockEntity(BlockPos pos, BlockState state) {
        super(ModBlockEntities.TEST_BLOCK_ENTITY_TYPE, pos, state);
    }

    // "Accessor" (getter) method
    // To access this value from outside of this class
    public int getInteractionCount() {
        return this.interactionCount;
    }
    // "Mutator" (setter) method
    // To change this value from outside of this class
    public void setInteractionCount(int newCount) {
        this.interactionCount = newCount;        
        // When changing values for the BlockEntity, make sure to mark it as dirty.
        // Otherwise, the new values won't be saved properly in the NBT data
        this.markDirty();
    }

    // Store data in the NBT of the BlockEntity
    @Override
    protected void writeNbt(NbtCompound nbt) {
        nbt.putInt(INTERACT_NBT_KEY, this.interactionCount);
        super.writeNbt(nbt);
    }
    // Read data from the NBT of the BlockEntity
    @Override
    public void readNbt(NbtCompound nbt) {
        super.readNbt(nbt);
        this.interactionCount = nbt.getInt(INTERACT_NBT_KEY);
    }
}
```

Now you have a custom `Block` which will interact with the player and save its data in the NBT using the custom `BlockEntity` and its `BlockEntityType` for registration.

## Implementing BlockEntity ticking

Create a new method, that will be called for every tick inside of the custom `BlockEntity` class, and implement your `tick` behavior. In this case, every 200 ticks (~ 10 sec) the `SoundEvents.BLOCK_ANVIL_USE` sound will be played.

In addition, create a new field to keep track of the ticks for the `BlockEntity` instance.

```java
public class TestBlockEntity extends BlockEntity {
    // The new field for the ticking.
    // If the value is important to keep, consider saving this field into the NBT values too.
    private int tickCounter = 0;

    // ...

    public TestBlockEntity(BlockPos pos, BlockState state) {
        super(ModBlockEntities.TEST_BLOCK_ENTITY_TYPE, pos, state);
    }

    // ...

    public static void tick(World world, BlockPos pos, BlockState blockState, BlockEntity blockEntity) {
        // Check if the blockEntity from the parameters is actualy this custom BlockEntity
        // You can also just work with a cast instead - we will check for the correct BlockEntity when calling this method anyways
        if (blockEntity instanceof TestBlockEntity testBlockEntity) {
            // Play the sound every 200 ticks with the use of the modulo operator
            if (testBlockEntity.tickCounter % 200 == 0) {
                world.playSound(null, pos, SoundEvents.BLOCK_ANVIL_USE, SoundCategory.BLOCKS, 1f, 1f);
            }
            // Increment the tick attribute of the instance
            testBlockEntity.tickCounter++;
        }
    }
}
```

Now `@Override` the `getTicker` method in the custom `Block` class to call the `BlockEntity`'s `tick` method.

```java
public class TestBlock extends BlockWithEntity {
    // ...

    @Nullable
    @Override
    public <T extends BlockEntity> BlockEntityTicker<T> getTicker(World world, BlockState state, BlockEntityType<T> type) {
        // Calls the custom BlockEntity's tick method if the getTicker method parameter's BlockEntityType and the specified BlockEntityType match up
        return checkType(type, ModBlockEntities.TEST_BLOCK_ENTITY_TYPE, TestBlockEntity::tick);
                
        // To pass over different parameters, use a Lambda Expression instead of the method reference (TestBlockEntity::tick)
        // and change the parameters in the BlockEntity's definition of this method to your liking
    }
}
```

Keep in mind that ticking BlockEntities in large quantities can cause massive client lag (FPS) and/or server lag (TPS). This is one of the reasons why players place composters on top of their hoppers in large redstone contraptions.

## Next Steps

- Create a block which explodes, after it hasn't been interacted with, for a whole day _(Hint: `world.getTimeOfDay()`)_ 
- Try experimenting with the `BlockEntity`'s NBT data. Can you save the `Entity`, which has interacted with the custom Block, and use this information? _(Hint: UUID)_
- Make a custom block, which spawns a hostile Entity group nearby (e.g. five zombies) and rewards the player upon defeating it.
