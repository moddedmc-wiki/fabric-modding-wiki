We accept contributions from anyone - you are welcome to fork and create pull requests adding content.

If you are unfamiliar with jekyll, checkout the jekyll documentation for adding pages - [which can be found here.](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/)

## Writing Style

Please write pages in American Standard English. If you feel it is nessecary, you can use the following free tools to correct grammatical and other errors with your writing:

- [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/)
- [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/)

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Clarity is key.</strong></p>
    <p>Expect your reader to be new to the modding scene, mark any content that isn't intended for beginners using callouts.</p>
</div>

When adding images, please name them in order of when they're listed on the page, eg: `index_0.png` for the first image. The page file should have it's own folder and be called `index.md`

## Code

Please use yarn at all times when editing the wiki.

There are plans to use an automatic mapping conversion script - allowing readers to switch between Mojang Mappings, Parchment and Yarn, similar to the Fabric Wiki's yarn code block plugin. However, this is not currently implemented.


When writing code, please comment **key methods and fields**.

You must not use code from other projects into **any** pages - if this is impossible to satisfy, you may link the code's GitHub page if it is visible source.

## Markdown Extensions

You can create scripts and use raw HTML in your pages - however, pages that use excessive scripts and HTML will not be accepted.

*Doks* adds multiple CSS classes that are available to use - [you should familiarlize yourself with them here.](https://doks.themejack.com/blue/manage-content)

Code blocks support the major programming languages.

```java
System.out.println("For example, this is Java.")
```
